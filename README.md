# Kashitachi's Drawabox Exercise Repo!

I don't really know what to say here. 
So this is basically a meme portfolio where I put my giant mountain of art. Hopefully this induces flat reactions from newbies (if it's wowing them, something has gone horribly wrong).

## Organisation
- Folders are organised by lesson
- Subfolders are usually organised by revision(s)
- The folder labelled "random" is for random art stuff. Quality not guaranteed.

## Special thanks
- Wojo for getting me into this in the first place
